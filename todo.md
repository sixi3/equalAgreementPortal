### Optimization Plan

**Phase 1: Codebase Analysis & Low-Hanging Fruit**

- [x] **Project Overview:** Examine the project structure, dependencies in `package.json`, and Next.js configuration (`next.config.js`).
- [x] **Component Analysis:** Review components in `src/components` for optimization opportunities (e.g., memoization, splitting large components).
- [x] **Static Asset Optimization:** Check static assets in `public` for web optimization.
- [x] **Code & Dependency Cleanup:** Find and remove unused files, dependencies, or code.

**Phase 2: Performance Enhancements**

- [x] **Bundle Size Analysis:** Use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to inspect the JavaScript bundle.
  - [x] Install and configure `@next/bundle-analyzer`.
  - [x] Run `npm run analyze` and analyze the output.
- [x] **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:** Identify components/pages for dynamic import with `next/dynamic`.
- [x] **State Management Review:** Optimize application state management to reduce re-renders.
  - [x] Create `AgreementContext.tsx` with a reducer and provider.
  - [x] Wrap `RootLayout` with `AgreementProvider`.
  - [x] Refactor `page.tsx` and all child components to use the context.

**Phase 3: Refactoring & Best Practices**

- [x] **Component Refactoring:** Refactor key components for readability, maintainability, and best practices.
  - [x] **Refactor `AgreementTemplate.tsx`**
    - [x] Create `src/components/pdf` directory for PDF components.
    - [x] Move `PdfHeader` logic to `src/components/pdf/PdfHeader.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `ServicesTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/ServicesTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `InsightsTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/InsightsTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `GenericTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/GenericTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `PricingSummary` logic to `src/components/pdf/PricingSummary.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `TermsAndConditions` logic to `src/components/pdf/TermsAndConditions.tsx`.

- [ ] **Styling Improvements:** Review `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` for efficiency.
- [ ] **Type Safety:** Enhance TypeScript usage in `src/types` and across the application.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Phase 7: Content Editing & Customization
**Goal:** Allow users to edit all text and tables in the agreement.

### State Management for Editable Content
- [ ] **Extend `AgreementContext`**:
    - [ ] Move `valueAddedServices`, `aggregatorServices`, and `pricingNotes` from `lib/agreement-data.ts` to `AgreementContext.tsx` to serve as the initial, editable state.
    - [ ] Add new fields to the context state for all editable content:
        - `agreementTitle: string` (for the main header).
        - `agreementIntroText: string` (for the introductory paragraph).
        - `valueAddedServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `aggregatorServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `pricingNotes: string[]`.
        - `termsAndConditionsText: string`.
    - [ ] Create a new reducer action, like `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT`, to handle saving all changes from the modal at once.

### Refactor PDF Components for Dynamic Content
- [ ] **`PdfHeader.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render an `agreementTitle` prop.
- [ ] **`AgreementTemplate.tsx`**:
    - [ ] Update to pull all editable content (title, intro text, tables, notes, T&Cs) from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Pass the dynamic content down as props to the relevant child PDF components.
    - [ ] Update the introductory text section to use `agreementIntroText` from the context.
- [ ] **`GenericTable.tsx`**: This component is already data-driven, so it will just need to receive the editable `valueAddedServices` and `aggregatorServices` data from context via `AgreementTemplate`.
- [ ] **`PricingSummary.tsx`**: Refactor to dynamically render editable `pricingNotes`.
- [ ] **`TermsAndConditions.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render a `termsAndConditionsText` prop.

### Enhance `AdditionalCostsModal.tsx` for Content Editing
- [ ] **UI Overhaul with Tabs**:
    - [ ] Reorganize the modal using a `Tabs` component (`components/ui/tabs`) to manage different editable sections without cluttering the UI. Create tabs like: "Fees & Notes", "Service Tables", and "Text Content".
- [ ] **"Text Content" Tab**:
    - [ ] Add an `Input` control for the `agreementTitle` ("ID Verification Agreement").
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `agreementIntroText`.
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `termsAndConditionsText`.
- [ ] **"Fees & Notes" Tab**:
    - [ ] Keep the existing inputs for "Set-up Fee" and "Annual Fee".
    - [ ] Add a UI to manage the `pricingNotes`. This could be a `Textarea` (one note per line) or a dynamic list of `Input` fields with "Add" and "Remove" buttons.
- [ ] **"Service Tables" Tab**:
    - [ ] Create an editable grid/form for "Value-added Services". It should allow users to edit the name and description of each service and to add or remove rows.
    - [ ] Do the same for "Aggregator Services".
- [ ] **Update Save Logic**:
    - [ ] On opening the modal, populate its local state with the current values from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Modify the `handleSave` function to dispatch the `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT` action, sending all the updated fields back to the global state.

**Last Updated:** December 2024
**Next Review:** After finalizing PDF download.

### Optimization Plan

**Phase 1: Codebase Analysis & Low-Hanging Fruit**

- [x] **Project Overview:** Examine the project structure, dependencies in `package.json`, and Next.js configuration (`next.config.js`).
- [x] **Component Analysis:** Review components in `src/components` for optimization opportunities (e.g., memoization, splitting large components).
- [x] **Static Asset Optimization:** Check static assets in `public` for web optimization.
- [x] **Code & Dependency Cleanup:** Find and remove unused files, dependencies, or code.

**Phase 2: Performance Enhancements**

- [x] **Bundle Size Analysis:** Use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to inspect the JavaScript bundle.
  - [x] Install and configure `@next/bundle-analyzer`.
  - [x] Run `npm run analyze` and analyze the output.
- [x] **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:** Identify components/pages for dynamic import with `next/dynamic`.
- [x] **State Management Review:** Optimize application state management to reduce re-renders.
  - [x] Create `AgreementContext.tsx` with a reducer and provider.
  - [x] Wrap `RootLayout` with `AgreementProvider`.
  - [x] Refactor `page.tsx` and all child components to use the context.

**Phase 3: Refactoring & Best Practices**

- [x] **Component Refactoring:** Refactor key components for readability, maintainability, and best practices.
  - [x] **Refactor `AgreementTemplate.tsx`**
    - [x] Create `src/components/pdf` directory for PDF components.
    - [x] Move `PdfHeader` logic to `src/components/pdf/PdfHeader.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `ServicesTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/ServicesTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `InsightsTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/InsightsTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `GenericTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/GenericTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `PricingSummary` logic to `src/components/pdf/PricingSummary.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `TermsAndConditions` logic to `src/components/pdf/TermsAndConditions.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `PdfFooter` logic to `src/components/pdf/PdfFooter.tsx`.
    - [x] Refactor `AgreementTemplate.tsx` to assemble the new, smaller components.
- [ ] **Styling Improvements:** Review `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` for efficiency.
- [ ] **Type Safety:** Enhance TypeScript usage in `src/types` and across the application.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Phase 7: Content Editing & Customization
**Goal:** Allow users to edit all text and tables in the agreement.

### State Management for Editable Content
- [ ] **Extend `AgreementContext`**:
    - [ ] Move `valueAddedServices`, `aggregatorServices`, and `pricingNotes` from `lib/agreement-data.ts` to `AgreementContext.tsx` to serve as the initial, editable state.
    - [ ] Add new fields to the context state for all editable content:
        - `agreementTitle: string` (for the main header).
        - `agreementIntroText: string` (for the introductory paragraph).
        - `valueAddedServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `aggregatorServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `pricingNotes: string[]`.
        - `termsAndConditionsText: string`.
    - [ ] Create a new reducer action, like `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT`, to handle saving all changes from the modal at once.

### Refactor PDF Components for Dynamic Content
- [ ] **`PdfHeader.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render an `agreementTitle` prop.
- [ ] **`AgreementTemplate.tsx`**:
    - [ ] Update to pull all editable content (title, intro text, tables, notes, T&Cs) from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Pass the dynamic content down as props to the relevant child PDF components.
    - [ ] Update the introductory text section to use `agreementIntroText` from the context.
- [ ] **`GenericTable.tsx`**: This component is already data-driven, so it will just need to receive the editable `valueAddedServices` and `aggregatorServices` data from context via `AgreementTemplate`.
- [ ] **`PricingSummary.tsx`**: Refactor to dynamically render editable `pricingNotes`.
- [ ] **`TermsAndConditions.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render a `termsAndConditionsText` prop.

### Enhance `AdditionalCostsModal.tsx` for Content Editing
- [ ] **UI Overhaul with Tabs**:
    - [ ] Reorganize the modal using a `Tabs` component (`components/ui/tabs`) to manage different editable sections without cluttering the UI. Create tabs like: "Fees & Notes", "Service Tables", and "Text Content".
- [ ] **"Text Content" Tab**:
    - [ ] Add an `Input` control for the `agreementTitle` ("ID Verification Agreement").
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `agreementIntroText`.
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `termsAndConditionsText`.
- [ ] **"Fees & Notes" Tab**:
    - [ ] Keep the existing inputs for "Set-up Fee" and "Annual Fee".
    - [ ] Add a UI to manage the `pricingNotes`. This could be a `Textarea` (one note per line) or a dynamic list of `Input` fields with "Add" and "Remove" buttons.
- [ ] **"Service Tables" Tab**:
    - [ ] Create an editable grid/form for "Value-added Services". It should allow users to edit the name and description of each service and to add or remove rows.
    - [ ] Do the same for "Aggregator Services".
- [ ] **Update Save Logic**:
    - [ ] On opening the modal, populate its local state with the current values from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Modify the `handleSave` function to dispatch the `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT` action, sending all the updated fields back to the global state.

**Last Updated:** December 2024
**Next Review:** After finalizing PDF download.

### Optimization Plan

**Phase 1: Codebase Analysis & Low-Hanging Fruit**

- [x] **Project Overview:** Examine the project structure, dependencies in `package.json`, and Next.js configuration (`next.config.js`).
- [x] **Component Analysis:** Review components in `src/components` for optimization opportunities (e.g., memoization, splitting large components).
- [x] **Static Asset Optimization:** Check static assets in `public` for web optimization.
- [x] **Code & Dependency Cleanup:** Find and remove unused files, dependencies, or code.

**Phase 2: Performance Enhancements**

- [x] **Bundle Size Analysis:** Use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to inspect the JavaScript bundle.
  - [x] Install and configure `@next/bundle-analyzer`.
  - [x] Run `npm run analyze` and analyze the output.
- [x] **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:** Identify components/pages for dynamic import with `next/dynamic`.
- [x] **State Management Review:** Optimize application state management to reduce re-renders.
  - [x] Create `AgreementContext.tsx` with a reducer and provider.
  - [x] Wrap `RootLayout` with `AgreementProvider`.
  - [x] Refactor `page.tsx` and all child components to use the context.

**Phase 3: Refactoring & Best Practices**

- [x] **Component Refactoring:** Refactor key components for readability, maintainability, and best practices.
  - [x] **Refactor `AgreementTemplate.tsx`**
    - [x] Create `src/components/pdf` directory for PDF components.
    - [x] Move `PdfHeader` logic to `src/components/pdf/PdfHeader.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `ServicesTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/ServicesTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `InsightsTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/InsightsTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `GenericTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/GenericTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `PricingSummary` logic to `src/components/pdf/PricingSummary.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `TermsAndConditions` logic to `src/components/pdf/TermsAndConditions.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `PdfFooter` logic to `src/components/pdf/PdfFooter.tsx`.
    - [x] Refactor `AgreementTemplate.tsx` to assemble the new, smaller components.
- [ ] **Styling Improvements:** Review `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` for efficiency.
- [ ] **Type Safety:** Enhance TypeScript usage in `src/types` and across the application.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Phase 7: Content Editing & Customization
**Goal:** Allow users to edit all text and tables in the agreement.

### State Management for Editable Content
- [ ] **Extend `AgreementContext`**:
    - [ ] Move `valueAddedServices`, `aggregatorServices`, and `pricingNotes` from `lib/agreement-data.ts` to `AgreementContext.tsx` to serve as the initial, editable state.
    - [ ] Add new fields to the context state for all editable content:
        - `agreementTitle: string` (for the main header).
        - `agreementIntroText: string` (for the introductory paragraph).
        - `valueAddedServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `aggregatorServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `pricingNotes: string[]`.
        - `termsAndConditionsText: string`.
    - [ ] Create a new reducer action, like `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT`, to handle saving all changes from the modal at once.

### Refactor PDF Components for Dynamic Content
- [ ] **`PdfHeader.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render an `agreementTitle` prop.
- [ ] **`AgreementTemplate.tsx`**:
    - [ ] Update to pull all editable content (title, intro text, tables, notes, T&Cs) from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Pass the dynamic content down as props to the relevant child PDF components.
    - [ ] Update the introductory text section to use `agreementIntroText` from the context.
- [ ] **`GenericTable.tsx`**: This component is already data-driven, so it will just need to receive the editable `valueAddedServices` and `aggregatorServices` data from context via `AgreementTemplate`.
- [ ] **`PricingSummary.tsx`**: Refactor to dynamically render editable `pricingNotes`.
- [ ] **`TermsAndConditions.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render a `termsAndConditionsText` prop.

### Enhance `AdditionalCostsModal.tsx` for Content Editing
- [ ] **UI Overhaul with Tabs**:
    - [ ] Reorganize the modal using a `Tabs` component (`components/ui/tabs`) to manage different editable sections without cluttering the UI. Create tabs like: "Fees & Notes", "Service Tables", and "Text Content".
- [ ] **"Text Content" Tab**:
    - [ ] Add an `Input` control for the `agreementTitle` ("ID Verification Agreement").
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `agreementIntroText`.
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `termsAndConditionsText`.
- [ ] **"Fees & Notes" Tab**:
    - [ ] Keep the existing inputs for "Set-up Fee" and "Annual Fee".
    - [ ] Add a UI to manage the `pricingNotes`. This could be a `Textarea` (one note per line) or a dynamic list of `Input` fields with "Add" and "Remove" buttons.
- [ ] **"Service Tables" Tab**:
    - [ ] Create an editable grid/form for "Value-added Services". It should allow users to edit the name and description of each service and to add or remove rows.
    - [ ] Do the same for "Aggregator Services".
- [ ] **Update Save Logic**:
    - [ ] On opening the modal, populate its local state with the current values from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Modify the `handleSave` function to dispatch the `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT` action, sending all the updated fields back to the global state.

**Last Updated:** December 2024
**Next Review:** After finalizing PDF download.

### Optimization Plan

**Phase 1: Codebase Analysis & Low-Hanging Fruit**

- [x] **Project Overview:** Examine the project structure, dependencies in `package.json`, and Next.js configuration (`next.config.js`).
- [x] **Component Analysis:** Review components in `src/components` for optimization opportunities (e.g., memoization, splitting large components).
- [x] **Static Asset Optimization:** Check static assets in `public` for web optimization.
- [x] **Code & Dependency Cleanup:** Find and remove unused files, dependencies, or code.

**Phase 2: Performance Enhancements**

- [x] **Bundle Size Analysis:** Use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to inspect the JavaScript bundle.
  - [x] Install and configure `@next/bundle-analyzer`.
  - [x] Run `npm run analyze` and analyze the output.
- [x] **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:** Identify components/pages for dynamic import with `next/dynamic`.
- [x] **State Management Review:** Optimize application state management to reduce re-renders.
  - [x] Create `AgreementContext.tsx` with a reducer and provider.
  - [x] Wrap `RootLayout` with `AgreementProvider`.
  - [x] Refactor `page.tsx` and all child components to use the context.

**Phase 3: Refactoring & Best Practices**

- [x] **Component Refactoring:** Refactor key components for readability, maintainability, and best practices.
  - [x] **Refactor `AgreementTemplate.tsx`**
    - [x] Create `src/components/pdf` directory for PDF components.
    - [x] Move `PdfHeader` logic to `src/components/pdf/PdfHeader.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `ServicesTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/ServicesTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `InsightsTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/InsightsTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `GenericTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/GenericTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `PricingSummary` logic to `src/components/pdf/PricingSummary.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `TermsAndConditions` logic to `src/components/pdf/TermsAndConditions.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `PdfFooter` logic to `src/components/pdf/PdfFooter.tsx`.
    - [x] Refactor `AgreementTemplate.tsx` to assemble the new, smaller components.
- [ ] **Styling Improvements:** Review `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` for efficiency.
- [ ] **Type Safety:** Enhance TypeScript usage in `src/types` and across the application.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Phase 7: Content Editing & Customization
**Goal:** Allow users to edit all text and tables in the agreement.

### State Management for Editable Content
- [ ] **Extend `AgreementContext`**:
    - [ ] Move `valueAddedServices`, `aggregatorServices`, and `pricingNotes` from `lib/agreement-data.ts` to `AgreementContext.tsx` to serve as the initial, editable state.
    - [ ] Add new fields to the context state for all editable content:
        - `agreementTitle: string` (for the main header).
        - `agreementIntroText: string` (for the introductory paragraph).
        - `valueAddedServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `aggregatorServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `pricingNotes: string[]`.
        - `termsAndConditionsText: string`.
    - [ ] Create a new reducer action, like `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT`, to handle saving all changes from the modal at once.

### Refactor PDF Components for Dynamic Content
- [ ] **`PdfHeader.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render an `agreementTitle` prop.
- [ ] **`AgreementTemplate.tsx`**:
    - [ ] Update to pull all editable content (title, intro text, tables, notes, T&Cs) from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Pass the dynamic content down as props to the relevant child PDF components.
    - [ ] Update the introductory text section to use `agreementIntroText` from the context.
- [ ] **`GenericTable.tsx`**: This component is already data-driven, so it will just need to receive the editable `valueAddedServices` and `aggregatorServices` data from context via `AgreementTemplate`.
- [ ] **`PricingSummary.tsx`**: Refactor to dynamically render editable `pricingNotes`.
- [ ] **`TermsAndConditions.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render a `termsAndConditionsText` prop.

### Enhance `AdditionalCostsModal.tsx` for Content Editing
- [ ] **UI Overhaul with Tabs**:
    - [ ] Reorganize the modal using a `Tabs` component (`components/ui/tabs`) to manage different editable sections without cluttering the UI. Create tabs like: "Fees & Notes", "Service Tables", and "Text Content".
- [ ] **"Text Content" Tab**:
    - [ ] Add an `Input` control for the `agreementTitle` ("ID Verification Agreement").
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `agreementIntroText`.
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `termsAndConditionsText`.
- [ ] **"Fees & Notes" Tab**:
    - [ ] Keep the existing inputs for "Set-up Fee" and "Annual Fee".
    - [ ] Add a UI to manage the `pricingNotes`. This could be a `Textarea` (one note per line) or a dynamic list of `Input` fields with "Add" and "Remove" buttons.
- [ ] **"Service Tables" Tab**:
    - [ ] Create an editable grid/form for "Value-added Services". It should allow users to edit the name and description of each service and to add or remove rows.
    - [ ] Do the same for "Aggregator Services".
- [ ] **Update Save Logic**:
    - [ ] On opening the modal, populate its local state with the current values from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Modify the `handleSave` function to dispatch the `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT` action, sending all the updated fields back to the global state.

### Optimization Plan

**Phase 1: Codebase Analysis & Low-Hanging Fruit**

- [x] **Project Overview:** Examine the project structure, dependencies in `package.json`, and Next.js configuration (`next.config.js`).
- [x] **Component Analysis:** Review components in `src/components` for optimization opportunities (e.g., memoization, splitting large components).
- [x] **Static Asset Optimization:** Check static assets in `public` for web optimization.
- [x] **Code & Dependency Cleanup:** Find and remove unused files, dependencies, or code.

**Phase 2: Performance Enhancements**

- [x] **Bundle Size Analysis:** Use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to inspect the JavaScript bundle.
  - [x] Install and configure `@next/bundle-analyzer`.
  - [x] Run `npm run analyze` and analyze the output.
- [x] **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:** Identify components/pages for dynamic import with `next/dynamic`.
- [x] **State Management Review:** Optimize application state management to reduce re-renders.
  - [x] Create `AgreementContext.tsx` with a reducer and provider.
  - [x] Wrap `RootLayout` with `AgreementProvider`.
  - [x] Refactor `page.tsx` and all child components to use the context.

**Phase 3: Refactoring & Best Practices**

- [x] **Component Refactoring:** Refactor key components for readability, maintainability, and best practices.
  - [x] **Refactor `AgreementTemplate.tsx`**
    - [x] Create `src/components/pdf` directory for PDF components.
    - [x] Move `PdfHeader` logic to `src/components/pdf/PdfHeader.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `ServicesTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/ServicesTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `InsightsTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/InsightsTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `GenericTable` logic to `src/components/pdf/GenericTable.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `PricingSummary` logic to `src/components/pdf/PricingSummary.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `TermsAndConditions` logic to `src/components/pdf/TermsAndConditions.tsx`.
    - [x] Move `PdfFooter` logic to `src/components/pdf/PdfFooter.tsx`.
    - [x] Refactor `AgreementTemplate.tsx` to assemble the new, smaller components.
- [ ] **Styling Improvements:** Review `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` for efficiency.
- [ ] **Type Safety:** Enhance TypeScript usage in `src/types` and across the application.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Phase 7: Content Editing & Customization
**Goal:** Allow users to edit all text and tables in the agreement.

### State Management for Editable Content
- [ ] **Extend `AgreementContext`**:
    - [ ] Move `valueAddedServices`, `aggregatorServices`, and `pricingNotes` from `lib/agreement-data.ts` to `AgreementContext.tsx` to serve as the initial, editable state.
    - [ ] Add new fields to the context state for all editable content:
        - `agreementTitle: string` (for the main header).
        - `agreementIntroText: string` (for the introductory paragraph).
        - `valueAddedServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `aggregatorServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `pricingNotes: string[]`.
        - `termsAndConditionsText: string`.
    - [ ] Create a new reducer action, like `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT`, to handle saving all changes from the modal at once.

### Refactor PDF Components for Dynamic Content
- [ ] **`PdfHeader.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render an `agreementTitle` prop.
- [ ] **`AgreementTemplate.tsx`**:
    - [ ] Update to pull all editable content (title, intro text, tables, notes, T&Cs) from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Pass the dynamic content down as props to the relevant child PDF components.
    - [ ] Update the introductory text section to use `agreementIntroText` from the context.
- [ ] **`GenericTable.tsx`**: This component is already data-driven, so it will just need to receive the editable `valueAddedServices` and `aggregatorServices` data from context via `AgreementTemplate`.
- [ ] **`PricingSummary.tsx`**: Refactor to dynamically render editable `pricingNotes`.
- [ ] **`TermsAndConditions.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render a `termsAndConditionsText` prop.

### Enhance `AdditionalCostsModal.tsx` for Content Editing
- [ ] **UI Overhaul with Tabs**:
    - [ ] Reorganize the modal using a `Tabs` component (`components/ui/tabs`) to manage different editable sections without cluttering the UI. Create tabs like: "Fees & Notes", "Service Tables", and "Text Content".
- [ ] **"Text Content" Tab**:
    - [ ] Add an `Input` control for the `agreementTitle` ("ID Verification Agreement").
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `agreementIntroText`.
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `termsAndConditionsText`.
- [ ] **"Fees & Notes" Tab**:
    - [ ] Keep the existing inputs for "Set-up Fee" and "Annual Fee".
    - [ ] Add a UI to manage the `pricingNotes`. This could be a `Textarea` (one note per line) or a dynamic list of `Input` fields with "Add" and "Remove" buttons.
- [ ] **"Service Tables" Tab**:
    - [ ] Create an editable grid/form for "Value-added Services". It should allow users to edit the name and description of each service and to add or remove rows.
    - [ ] Do the same for "Aggregator Services".
- [ ] **Update Save Logic**:
    - [ ] On opening the modal, populate its local state with the current values from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Modify the `handleSave` function to dispatch the `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT` action, sending all the updated fields back to the global state.

## üéõÔ∏è Phase 7: Content Editing & Customization
**Goal:** Allow users to edit all text and tables in the agreement.

### State Management for Editable Content
- [ ] **Extend `AgreementContext`**:
    - [ ] Move `valueAddedServices`, `aggregatorServices`, and `pricingNotes` from `lib/agreement-data.ts` to `AgreementContext.tsx` to serve as the initial, editable state.
    - [ ] Add new fields to the context state for all editable content:
        - `agreementTitle: string` (for the main header).
        - `agreementIntroText: string` (for the introductory paragraph).
        - `valueAddedServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `aggregatorServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `pricingNotes: string[]`.
        - `termsAndConditionsText: string`.
    - [ ] Create a new reducer action, like `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT`, to handle saving all changes from the modal at once.

### Refactor PDF Components for Dynamic Content
- [ ] **`PdfHeader.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render an `agreementTitle` prop.
- [ ] **`AgreementTemplate.tsx`**:
    - [ ] Update to pull all editable content (title, intro text, tables, notes, T&Cs) from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Pass the dynamic content down as props to the relevant child PDF components.
    - [ ] Update the introductory text section to use `agreementIntroText` from the context.
- [ ] **`GenericTable.tsx`**: This component is already data-driven, so it will just need to receive the editable `valueAddedServices` and `aggregatorServices` data from context via `AgreementTemplate`.
- [ ] **`PricingSummary.tsx`**: Refactor to dynamically render editable `pricingNotes`.
- [ ] **`TermsAndConditions.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render a `termsAndConditionsText` prop.

### Enhance `AdditionalCostsModal.tsx` for Content Editing
- [ ] **UI Overhaul with Tabs**:
    - [ ] Reorganize the modal using a `Tabs` component (`components/ui/tabs`) to manage different editable sections without cluttering the UI. Create tabs like: "Fees & Notes", "Service Tables", and "Text Content".
- [ ] **"Text Content" Tab**:
    - [ ] Add an `Input` control for the `agreementTitle` ("ID Verification Agreement").
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `agreementIntroText`.
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `termsAndConditionsText`.
- [ ] **"Fees & Notes" Tab**:
    - [ ] Keep the existing inputs for "Set-up Fee" and "Annual Fee".
    - [ ] Add a UI to manage the `pricingNotes`. This could be a `Textarea` (one note per line) or a dynamic list of `Input` fields with "Add" and "Remove" buttons.
- [ ] **"Service Tables" Tab**:
    - [ ] Create an editable grid/form for "Value-added Services". It should allow users to edit the name and description of each service and to add or remove rows.
    - [ ] Do the same for "Aggregator Services".
- [ ] **Update Save Logic**:
    - [ ] On opening the modal, populate its local state with the current values from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Modify the `handleSave` function to dispatch the `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT` action, sending all the updated fields back to the global state.

## üéõÔ∏è Phase 7: Content Editing & Customization
**Goal:** Allow users to edit all text and tables in the agreement.

### State Management for Editable Content
- [ ] **Extend `AgreementContext`**:
    - [ ] Move `valueAddedServices`, `aggregatorServices`, and `pricingNotes` from `lib/agreement-data.ts` to `AgreementContext.tsx` to serve as the initial, editable state.
    - [ ] Add new fields to the context state for all editable content:
        - `agreementTitle: string` (for the main header).
        - `agreementIntroText: string` (for the introductory paragraph).
        - `valueAddedServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `aggregatorServices: { name: string; description: string }[]`.
        - `pricingNotes: string[]`.
        - `termsAndConditionsText: string`.
    - [ ] Create a new reducer action, like `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT`, to handle saving all changes from the modal at once.

### Refactor PDF Components for Dynamic Content
- [ ] **`PdfHeader.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render an `agreementTitle` prop.
- [ ] **`AgreementTemplate.tsx`**:
    - [ ] Update to pull all editable content (title, intro text, tables, notes, T&Cs) from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Pass the dynamic content down as props to the relevant child PDF components.
    - [ ] Update the introductory text section to use `agreementIntroText` from the context.
- [ ] **`GenericTable.tsx`**: This component is already data-driven, so it will just need to receive the editable `valueAddedServices` and `aggregatorServices` data from context via `AgreementTemplate`.
- [ ] **`PricingSummary.tsx`**: Refactor to dynamically render editable `pricingNotes`.
- [ ] **`TermsAndConditions.tsx`**: Modify to accept and render a `termsAndConditionsText` prop.

### Enhance `AdditionalCostsModal.tsx` for Content Editing
- [ ] **UI Overhaul with Tabs**:
    - [ ] Reorganize the modal using a `Tabs` component (`components/ui/tabs`) to manage different editable sections without cluttering the UI. Create tabs like: "Fees & Notes", "Service Tables", and "Text Content".
- [ ] **"Text Content" Tab**:
    - [ ] Add an `Input` control for the `agreementTitle` ("ID Verification Agreement").
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `agreementIntroText`.
    - [ ] Add a `Textarea` for the `termsAndConditionsText`.
- [ ] **"Fees & Notes" Tab**:
    - [ ] Keep the existing inputs for "Set-up Fee" and "Annual Fee".
    - [ ] Add a UI to manage the `pricingNotes`. This could be a `Textarea` (one note per line) or a dynamic list of `Input` fields with "Add" and "Remove" buttons.
- [ ] **"Service Tables" Tab**:
    - [ ] Create an editable grid/form for "Value-added Services". It should allow users to edit the name and description of each service and to add or remove rows.
    - [ ] Do the same for "Aggregator Services".
- [ ] **Update Save Logic**:
    - [ ] On opening the modal, populate its local state with the current values from `AgreementContext`.
    - [ ] Modify the `handleSave` function to dispatch the `UPDATE_AGREEMENT_CONTENT` action, sending all the updated fields back to the global state.
